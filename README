This is my implementation of the theater organizer for the Movie Theater 
Seating Challenge 2020 given to me by Walmart.

I first made sure I had "make" and "zip" installed in my Linux distribution. I 
am using Windows, so I'm running on WSL with Ubuntu.

To create a command-line executable for this solution, run "make" inside the 
directory in which it was unzipped. This should create a file called 
"theater_organizer" which can be executed using:

./theater_organizer [FILENAME]

where "FILENAME" is the name of the input file to be used to determine 
reservations.

To run the tests for the solution, use "make tests". This will create a 
distributable .zip file, unzip its contents to a temporary directory, and run 
tests on its contents. Then, it will delete the temporary directory as well as 
the .zip file.

For this solution, I assumed that the output file was to be a .txt file. I 
wrote the solution so that the output is put into a newly-created file called 
"result.txt". If the file already exists, then it is overwritten.

The tests I ran on my solution were...

I am extremely grateful to be considered as a Software Engineer Intern for 
Walmart and I appreciate the time taken to interview me and to examine this 
solution. Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.
